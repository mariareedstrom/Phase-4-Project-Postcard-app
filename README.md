# Postcard App, a Phase 4 Project

## The Quick Description

This project was created to demonstrate skills learned in the 4th Phase of Flatiron School's Software Development program.  
It is a built with a React frontend and a Rails API, deployed to Render. 

## The Story
Thanks to modern day technology, good old snail mail is slowly becoming history. When was the last time you received a postcard? Remember how fun it was to get one from a distant destination? Sure, we can scroll through miles of feeds on social media to see if a friend or relative posted from their latest travels, but wouldn't it be nicer to get a postcard?
With the Postcard App you can! This is an electronic version of sending,  receiving and collecting postcards. Easy modern day technology, sprinkled with some good old nostalgia.

## The User Features
In this application users can sign up to create an account, log in with a secure password and remain logged in while navigating the pages of the application. Once logged in, users can create and share postcards with friends. Users can edit or delete postcards they have created. Users can leave a comment to any postcard, and comments can be edited and/or deleted by the users who creat them.
