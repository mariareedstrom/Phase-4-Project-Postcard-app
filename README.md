## The Story
Thanks to modern day technology, good old snail mail is slowly becoming history. When was the last time you received a postcard? Remember how fun it was to get one from a distant destination? Sure, we can scroll through miles of feeds on social media to see if a friend or relative posted from their latest travels, but wouldn't it be nicer to get a postcard?
With the Postcard App you can! This is an electronic version of sending,  receiving and collecting postcards. <em>Easy modern day technology, sprinkled with some good old nostalgia.<em>

## The User Features
